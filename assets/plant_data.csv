One more step before you can plant tomatoes is soil solarization, which is especially important in growing regions with cold soil during the planting season.",Space rows of most tomato plants 4 feet apart. Generous spacing between rows makes for easy harvesting and good airflow between plants. Plant indeterminate tomato varieties that are not caged in rows at least 6 feet apart so you still have room to walk between them toward the end of the season.,"Water correctly: Do not overwater.

Carrots taste best when plants grow rapidly and mature before the heat of summer.,Seeded carrots should be spaced 2-3 inches between plants in the row with rows 12-18 inches apart. Dense plantings will reduce weed pressure. Planting radishes with carrots helps minimize the crusting problem and identifies where the planted rows are. Some gardeners sow seeds in wide beds rather than rows.,"Carrots need about an inch of water per week when young, but as the roots mature, increase water to 2 inches per week.
